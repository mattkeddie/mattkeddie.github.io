        <p class="subheading">BROADCAST OVERLAY</p>
        <p class="description">An overlay to be used in the production of matches within the Rocket League eSport. The spectator UI in-game whilst it has no obvious flaws and is perfectly functional, there is a distict lack of detail. Whilst one solution would be to overlay an image file over the screen in the broadcasting software, overlays such as this add further detail for the viewer and after setting up before a match, is completely automated for the remainder of the match. Through the use of a plugin made for the game called Simple Overlay System (or SOS for short), you can connect via a WebSocket connection and have all game data pulled through a relay in real-time! These come in the form of events and then you can use JavaScript to alter the appearance of the overlay based on these events.</p>

        <p>Below I will add some screenshots of the overlay in different states, to show every screen it can show. I expect not everybody looking at this understands the game of Rocket League, so I will do my best to explain what is going on and what the overlay is showing, otherwise it might just look like a load of clutter!</p>
