        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Football - I support Chelsea FC. I have played for most of my life, occasionally given coaching style advise for my younger neighbours to help them find ways to improve at the sport and have been a qualified referee by Hampshire FA since 2016, officiating in two local cup finals!</li>
            <li>Music - I am an Ed Sheeran fan, I sing and play guitar, performing at various Open-Mic Nights. I absolutely LOVE live music. When I perform live I use a tool called a Loop Pedal, essentially creating my own backing track live by looping things on top of each other. I post videos occasionally online on a <a id="youtube-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0DvKS265z80ryL_fUz0bDA">YouTube Channel</a> for my Musical Adventures</li>
            <li>Programming, problem Solving and being creative - I enjoy the satisfaction of making things, whether that be creating a website such as this one, or writing my own music to maybe perform at the aforementioned Open-Mic Nights. I feel a great deal of satisfaction when I create things, along with solving problems</li>
            <li>Esports Production/Commentary - I have always somewhat enjoyed commentating things. As weird as it sounds, I used to commentate myself playing football in the garden when I was younger, I must have driven everyone mad! I have now transferred this skill into commentating eSports. A list of <a id="liquipedia-link" href="https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/User:Kedsypoo">Notable Events</a> which I have been a part of can be found here.</li>
